# ALT Rails

## Introduction

> So what is ALT .NET? And how does it differ from the .NET that we already know and love? What are these values that many of us think are missing? What are these alternative tools, techniques, and practices that ALT .NET'ers are espousing? Let's first examine the original tenets of being an ALT .NET developer.

**ALT Rails** tries to answer the same questions for Ruby on Rails. There's an increase of interest on this topic as some of the big companies using the framework share:

## ALT Rails Developers Principles 

1. Pragmatic developers who use whatever works are always looking for a better way
> Solutions to problems hardly appear, fighting the tools we use to deliver the solutions.
> If Ruby on Rails is not serving us at any moment, we have the right to swap it whenever we see fit, without a lot of hassle. Business rules shouldn't be couple to any infrastructure details.  A web framework is part of the infrastructure. 
  
2. Look outside of the Ruby on Rails community to adopt best practices from everywhere
> Ideas are discoveries, not inventions. 

3. Understand the value of simplification and keep looking for ways to improve the code-base


4. Realize that tools are great but what matters are principles and knowledge
> The best tools encourage the adoption of good Software Engineering principles.

## ALT Rails Way

Applications exist to support a Business Domain.

The fundamental truth of software development is that code is subject to change - all the time.

The purpose of Software Architecture is to make a structure that enables flexibility.

> The primary purpose of architecture is to support the life cycle of the system.*Location 1928*[^1]

The one practical aspect that reveals the health of a code-base is 'how easy it is to change it.'

Frameworks architecture is about the tool, not the business. Software Architecture is the structure given to a system by its builders.

> The architecture of a software system is the shape given to that system by those who build it[^1]

Developers drive the shape of a system while introducing new features to a plan.  

The final structure, thus, supports operational business processes. 

The architecture of frameworks describes the structure of that system.

> Architectures are not (or should not be) about frameworks. Frameworks should not supply architectures.[^1]
