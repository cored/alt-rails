# ALT Rails

## Introduction

> So what is ALT .NET? And how does it differ from the .NET that we already know and love? What are these values that many of us think are missing? What are these alternative tools, techniques, and practices that ALT .NET'ers are espousing? Let's first examine the original tenets of being an ALT .NET developer.

**ALT Rails** tries to answer the same questions for Ruby on Rails. There's an increase of interest on this topic as some of the big companies using the framework share:

## ALT Rails Developers Principles 

1. Pragmatic developers who use whatever works are always looking for a better way
> Solutions to problems hardly appear, fighting the tools we use to deliver the solutions.
> If Ruby on Rails is not serving us at any moment, we have the right to swap it whenever we see fit, without a lot of hassle. Business rules shouldn't be couple to any infrastructure details.  A web framework is part of the infrastructure. 
  
2. Look outside of the Ruby on Rails community to adopt best practices from everywhere
> Ideas are discoveries, not inventions. 

3. Understand the value of simplification and keep looking for ways to improve the code-base


4. Realize that tools are great but what matters are principles and knowledge
> The best tools encourage the adoption of good Software Engineering principles.
